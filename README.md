# Clustering-Project

I have taken the stocks data in this project and tried to find the answers of the below question:

1) Which all stocks are apparently similar in performance
2) How many Unique patterns that exist in the historical stock data set, based on fluctuations in price.
3) Identify which all stocks are moving together and which all stocks are different from each other.
